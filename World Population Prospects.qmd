## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(curl)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(stringr)
library(janitor)
```

```{r}

# Specify the web address of the Excel file
url <- "https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Files/1_Indicators%20(Standard)/EXCEL_FILES/1_General/WPP2022_GEN_F01_DEMOGRAPHIC_INDICATORS_COMPACT_REV1.xlsx"

raw_data <- "WPP2022_GEN_F01_DEMOGRAPHIC_INDICATORS_COMPACT_REV1.xlsx"

curl_download(url, destfile = raw_data)
```

```{r}

# Downloaded sheets
sheets <- excel_sheets(raw_data)

# Select the first two sheets
selected_sheets <- sheets[1:2]

# Function to read and clean data from a sheet
read_clean <- function(file_path, sheet) {
  read_excel(file_path, sheet = sheet, skip = 16, col_types = "text") |> 
    mutate(type = sheet)
}

# Read and clean selected sheets, then bind them into a single data frame
data <- map_df(selected_sheets, ~read_clean(raw_data, .)) |> 
  clean_names()

```

```{r}

```

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
